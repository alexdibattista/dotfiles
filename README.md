### Notes:

pyenv zlib issue:
`sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /`

### TODO:

- [ ] Add linking to install.sh - should I link folders or files? (don't forget nvim/autoload))
- [ ] Figure out how to link ssh keys without committing them to git.
- [ ] Script out download and install of zlib before pyenv and python install
